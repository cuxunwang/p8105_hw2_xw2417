This file is the solution to P8105 Homework 2 from Xun Wang (xw2417).

## Problem 1

This problem uses the *Mr. Trash Wheel* dataset.

#### 1.1 Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet.

The code chunk below reads and cleans the *Mr. Trash Wheel* sheet. It
omits non-data entrues and rows not including dumpster-specific data,
and rounds the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and
converts the result to an integer variable.

``` r
mr_trash_wheel_data = 
  readxl::read_excel(
    "data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:N338"
    ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    date = str_sub(as.character(date), -2, -1),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)) %>% 
  select(dumpster, year, month, day = date, everything()) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    plastic_bottles:sports_balls,
    names_to = "trash_category",
    values_to = "number"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(number = as.numeric(number))
```

#### 1.2 Read and clean precipitation data.

The code chunk below read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and
2018. It omits rows without precipitation data and adds a variable year.
Then, it combines precipitation datasets and convert month to a
character variable.

``` r
precip_data_2017 = 
  readxl::read_excel(
    "data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14"
    ) %>%
  mutate(year = "2017") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 

precip_data_2018 = 
  readxl::read_excel(
    "data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14"
    ) %>%
  mutate(year = "2018") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total)

precip_data = 
  bind_rows(precip_data_2017, precip_data_2018) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  select(year, month, total_inch = total)
```

**Comments on cleaning data:** Both the *Mr. Trash Wheel* and the
*precipitation* datasets are cleaned by `janitor::clean_names`. The
*Mr. Trash Wheel* data is also tidied by `pivot_longer` (I combined all
the different trash types into one column named *trash\_category* and
put the values to the column *number*). Since there are column *year*
and *month* already, I simplied the *date* column to *day* column only
leaving the “day” information in this column.

**Comments on the data:** In the *Mr. Trash Wheel* dataset, there are
285 observations between 5/16/2014 and 7/18/2018 for 7 categories of
trash. The total weight and volume of trash, and the home number the
trash powered in each observation are also recorded.For example, on
5/15/2015 in dumpster 60, the total trash weighed 1.95 tons and had a
volume of 9 cubic yards, which was used to power 33 homes (key
variables). In the *precipitation* dataset, there are 19 observations
between January 2017 and July 2018.For each observation, the total
inches of the precipitation was recored. For example, in January 2017,
the precipitation was 2.34 inches (key variables). For available data,
the **total** precipitation in 2018 was **23.5 inches**. The **median**
number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was **8**.
